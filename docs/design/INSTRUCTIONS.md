# INSTRUCTIONS: Design Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains design documents such as:

- System architecture
- Data flow
- Model design
- Pipeline structure
- Deployment design

## How to fill README.md

The `README.md` gives a template index and suggested sections.
You should:

- Add links to detailed design documents as separate files.
- Store editable diagrams in `docs/figures/` and reference them here.

## Best practices

- Keep documents modular: one file per major topic.
- Prefer diagrams (sequence, flow, architecture) stored as `.svg` or `.drawio`.
- Update this directory whenever system architecture changes.
