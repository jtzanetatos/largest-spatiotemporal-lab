# Documentation Structure – Instructions

This project uses a structured documentation layout to make it easy to find and update docs.

## Top-level

- `docs/README.md`  
  High-level documentation index for the project. Links to ADRs, design docs, API docs, and any external resources.

## Subdirectories

### `docs/adr/`

Purpose:

- Record Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): why certain tools, patterns, or architectures were chosen.

How to use:

- Keep an index in `docs/adr/README.md`.
- For each new decision, create a file like `adr-0001-use-hydra.md`.
- Follow the ADR template provided in `adr/README.md`.

### `docs/design/`

Purpose:

- Describe system, data, and model design.
- Capture diagrams, flows, and design rationale that are not ADRs.

How to use:

- Use `docs/design/README.md` as an index for design documents.
- Add separate files for substantial topics (e.g. `data-flow.md`, `model-architecture.md`).
- Diagrams can be stored as image files under `docs/figures/` and linked from here.

### `docs/api/`

Purpose:

- Document public APIs for this project:
  - HTTP APIs (e.g. FastAPI endpoints).
  - Python library APIs (public modules/classes/functions).
  - CLI entrypoints.

How to use:

- Use `docs/api/README.md` as a table of contents.
- Link to autogenerated docs (e.g. OpenAPI, sphinx, mkdocs) or manually maintained sections.

### `docs/figures/`

Purpose:

- Store image assets used in documentation:
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Plots and figures for reports

How to use:

- Place images under `docs/figures/` and link to them from design/API docs.
- Keep `docs/figures/README.md` as a short description and, optionally, a small index if there are many images.

### `docs/references/` (optional)

Purpose:

- Collect domain knowledge:
  - Papers
  - Blog posts
  - External documentation links

How to use:

- Create `docs/references/README.md` only if needed.
- Use it as a curated list of external resources.

---

General guidelines:

- Keep READMEs short and focused.
- When a section grows large, factor it into a separate markdown file and link it from the corresponding README.
- Prefer relative links to other docs and to `docs/figures/`.
